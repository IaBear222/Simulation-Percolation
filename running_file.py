"""
This file is used to run the simulation of percolation,
It generates a random system of size n with a probability p of gatting a particule in each place of space .
Then it verifies if there is or not percolation

inputs :
    n : int : size of the system
    p : float : probability of getting a particule in each place of space
    repet : int : number of times to repeat the process

outputs :
    the system may be plotted with the particules and limits of the system using rdm_syst function
    the percolation rate and the number of paths found this kind of system using run_boucle function
